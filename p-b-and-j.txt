Ingredients:
Two slices of bread.
Jar of peanut butter.
Jar of strawberry preserves (or your favorite jelly substance).

Directions:
1. Lay the two slices of bread side by side.
2. Use a butter knife to spread peanut butter on one slice of bread.
(use as much or as little as you like - this is a matter of taste)
Ensure even coverage so you won't have some spots that have too much peanut butter while others don't have enough.
3. Clean off the butter knife or get a clean one.
4. Use a butter knife to spread strawberry preserves on the other slice of bread.
Ensure even coverage for the same reasons as even peanut butter coverage.

Optional:
1. Slice in half diagonally.
2. Cut off the edges (some people really don't like the edges).
3. Serve with a glass of cold milk.
